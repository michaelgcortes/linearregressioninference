# Linear Regression for Statistical Inference

Linear regression is one of the main methods used in machine learning for making good out of sample predictions, but it can also be used to conduct statistical inference. That is, to obtain a statistically rigorous understanding of how the variables in your data set actually impact your target metric. 

This is an R markdown notebook that guides you through an example of using linear regression to perform statistical inference. The video for this is found at https://youtu.be/xuXTg16booA.
